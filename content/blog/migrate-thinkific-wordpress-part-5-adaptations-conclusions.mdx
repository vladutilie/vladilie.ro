In the <Link href="/blog/migrate-thinkific-wordpress-part-4-reviews-import">fourth part</Link> of this 5-article series, I concluded the implementation of functions for custom import commands for users, progress, and reviews.

In the **last part**, I will talk about the customizations I made to the Masterclass online site and specifically go through the adaptations I made to the theme, `Tutor LMS` templates, and `WooCommerce`.
Below is the list of articles in the series:"

## The `Tutor LMS` dashboard
The `Tutor LMS` user dashboard on the Masterclass online site looked something like this:"
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/vladilie-ro/image/upload/v1706616716/blog/1.%20migrate-thinkific-to-wordpress/tutor-lms-user-dashboard_do6uvi.webp" alt="Tutor LMS user control panel" className="rounded-md shadow-lg"/>
It would have been a bit complicated to merge the two control panels, the one from `WooCommerce` and the one shown in the picture from `Tutor LMS`, into a single one, so I just linked them together.
If the user needs information about orders, they can find it in the `WooCommerce` panel; if they need information about the courses they have enrolled in, they can find it in the `Tutor LMS` panel, both accessible through direct links.

To add the "Order Dashboard" link (marked with <span className="border border-green-500">green</span>), I overwrote the `/dashboard.php` template of `Tutor LMS`: I copied the contents of the `/wp-content/plugins/tutor/templates` directory to the `/wp-content/themes/child-theme/tutor` directory and added the following item to the navigation links list (inside the `<ul class="tutor-dashboard-permalinks">` element):
```php showLineNumbers title="dashboard.php" caption="/wp-content/themes/child-theme/tutor"
<li class="tutor-dashboard-menu-item tutor-dashboard-menu-my-profile ">
    <a class="tutor-dashboard-menu-item-link tutor-fs-6 tutor-color-black" href="<?php echo esc_url( wc_get_page_permalink( 'myaccount' ) ); ?>">
        <span class='tutor-icon-arrow-right-left tutor-dashboard-menu-item-icon'></span>
        <span class='tutor-dashboard-menu-item-text tutor-ml-12'>Panou de comenzi</span>
    </a>
</li>
```

Now, to remove the links marked with <span className="border border-red-500">red</span> in the image above, because such functionalities are not needed, I added the following filter to the `functions.php` file in the theme:
```php showLineNumbers title="functions.php" caption="/wp-content/themes/child-theme/tutor"
// Remove the page tabs from the panel sidebar.
add_filter(
    'tutor_dashboard/nav_items',
	function( $defaults ) {
        unset( $defaults['wishlist'] );
		unset( $defaults['my-quiz-attempts'] );
		unset( $defaults['question-answer'] );

		return $defaults;
});
```

## The `WooCommerce` dashboard
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/vladilie-ro/image/upload/v1706623254/blog/1.%20migrate-thinkific-to-wordpress/woocommerce-user-dashboard_wgteeh.webp" alt="WooCommerce user control panel" className="rounded-md shadow-lg"/>
To add the link to the `Tutor LMS` dashboard in the navigation menu of `WooCommerce`, for overriding, I copied the template `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/myaccount/navigation.php` to the directory `/wp-content/themes/child-theme/woocommerce/myaccount/navigation.php` and added the following element as the first item in the `<ul>` list:
```php showLineNumbers title="navigation.php" caption="/wp-content/themes/child-theme/woocommerce/myaccount"
<li class="woocommerce-MyAccount-navigation-link woocommerce-MyAccount-navigation-link--dashboard">
    <a href="<?php echo esc_url( tutor_utils()->tutor_dashboard_url() ); ?>"><strong>Panou cursuri</strong></a>
</li>
```

## The `Tutor LMS` authentication form
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/vladilie-ro/image/upload/v1706624461/blog/1.%20migrate-thinkific-to-wordpress/tutor-login-form_ezqrm2.webp" alt="Tutor LMS login form" className="rounded-md shadow-lg"/>
During the migration and dealing with user accounts, I didn't want to make it intrusive and, especially, to violate the General Data Protection Regulation.
So, I approached this differently by notifying users through a message in the login form that the site has moved to another platform. If they had an account before, they could request a password reset link to log in.
To add this message, I used hooks in the `functions.php` file of the theme:
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php" caption="/wp-content/themes/child-theme/"
// Add custom message in the Tutor LMS login form.
add_action(
    'tutor_login_form_middle',
    function () {
        $lost_pass_url = wp_lostpassword_url();
        ?>
        <p>Recent am migrat site-ul pe o nouă platformă. Dacă aveai cont înainte, te rugăm <a href="<?php echo esc_url( $lost_pass_url ); ?>">să-ți resetezi parola</a>.</p>
        <?php
    }
);
```

## Other filters for `WooCommerce`
`Tutor LMS` being integrated with the `WooCommerce` e-commerce engine, each course in `Tutor LMS` has a corresponding product linked in `WooCommerce`.
Unfortunately, `Tutor LMS` does not automatically hide `WooCommerce` products specifically created for courses.
Consequently, these products could be added to the cart during a purchase, both as products and courses.
To avoid such situations, I use the filter below, which hides products from areas like the shop page and related products.
```php showLineNumbers title="functions.php" caption="/wp-content/themes/child-theme/"
// Hide products from Woo shop page.
add_filter( 'woocommerce_product_is_visible', '__return_false' );
```

But that's not enough.
Products would still be accessible at a direct address, for example: `https://mclass.test/product/product-name`.
Applying the filter below disables access to product pages:
```php showLineNumbers title="functions.php" caption="/wp-content/themes/child-theme/"
// Remove single page for Woo products.
add_filter(
	'woocommerce_register_post_type_product',
	function ( $args ) {
		$args['publicly_queryable'] = false;
		$args['public']             = false;

		return $args;
	},
	12
);
```

A final filter that I used is for removing the "quantity" field from the shopping cart page to prevent increasing the quantity.
It wouldn't make sense for a user to purchase a quantity greater than 1 for a course.
```php showLineNumbers title="functions.php" caption="/wp-content/themes/child-theme/"
// Hide quantity input field from cart.
add_filter( 'woocommerce_is_sold_individually', '__return_true' );
```

Also, to remove the quantity field from the cart, I copied the template `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/cart/cart.php` to `/wp-content/themes/child-theme/woocommerce/cart/cart.php` to override it, and then removed the following lines from it:
```php showLineNumbers title="cart.php" caption="/wp-content/themes/child-theme/woocommerce/cart/" {1, 5-29}
<th class="product-quantity"><?php esc_html_e( 'Quantity', 'woocommerce' ); ?></th>

// AND

<td class="product-quantity" data-title="<?php esc_attr_e( 'Quantity', 'woocommerce' ); ?>">
<?php
if ( $_product->is_sold_individually() ) {
    $min_quantity = 1;
    $max_quantity = 1;
} else {
    $min_quantity = 0;
    $max_quantity = $_product->get_max_purchase_quantity();
}

$product_quantity = woocommerce_quantity_input(
    array(
        'input_name'   => "cart[{$cart_item_key}][qty]",
        'input_value'  => $cart_item['quantity'],
        'max_value'    => $max_quantity,
        'min_value'    => $min_quantity,
        'product_name' => $product_name,
    ),
    $_product,
    false
);

echo apply_filters( 'woocommerce_cart_item_quantity', $product_quantity, $cart_item_key, $cart_item ); // PHPCS: XSS ok.
?>
</td>
```

## Migration to production
After all the changes were made, migrations executed, courses arranged, and the store prepared with all the integrations, I move the site from the local environment to the `production` environment using the `All in One WP Migration` plugin.
Throughout the development process of the new site, after each major step (creating courses and building their pages with `Elementor`, installing and configuring `WooCommerce`, running migrations, etc.), I made a backup with `All in One WP Migration`.
If I had identified any data discrepancies or a malfunctioning part of the site while working on the next step, I would have reverted to the previous state of the site.
In essence, I would have performed a `roll-back`, and this way, I could avoid losing too much progress.

When I had a backup very close to a version ready for production, I placed it on the production subdomain, and that's how I had a smooth development-launch process.

## Conclusions
WordPress once again provides a solution to a problem I encountered.
The related technologies developed around it are truly a breath of fresh air, and if you enjoy this environment, it's worth investing time and energy.
Certainly, impressive results can be achieved using `WordPress`, even for enterprise projects—no need to say that, Automattic proves it every day.

<Link href="https://wp-cli.org">WP-CLI</Link> is a very powerful and flexible tool that can be helpful in many situations like these migrations.
I recommend it every time I have the chance; I've used it in dozens of projects, and each time, I've successfully accomplished everything I needed with it.
