In the <Link href="/blog/migrate-thinkific-wordpress-part-3-progress-import">previous article</Link>, the third part of this 5-article series, I described the implementation of the `WP-CLI` command to import the progress of courses for users.

In **part four**, I will describe the functionality of the `WP-CLI` command to import reviews given by users to the courses.
Below, I also provide you with the list of articles in the series:

</div>

## Declaring the review import method
I start again by declaring the method and the helper variables for reading from the file:
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php"
public function import_reviews(): void {
    global $wp_filesystem, $wpdb;

    include_once ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/file.php';
    WP_Filesystem();

    $files = array( 'course-1-reviews.json', 'course-2-reviews.json', 'course-3-reviews', 'course-4-reviews.json' );
    //...
}
```
I also declared a variable of type array with the list of files containing reviews for courses, which I will iterate through using `foreach ($files as $file)`.

## Reading from file
### `JSON` file structure
I'm putting here again the structure of the review file in `JSON` format:
```json showLineNumbers title="course-*-reviews.json"
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "<course-name>",
  "aggregateRating": { "@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": "4.6", "reviewCount": 5 },
  "review": [
    {
      "@type": "Review",
      "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "<reviewer-name>" },
      "description": "<review-description>",
      "name": "<review-title>",
      "date": "November 26, 2021",
      "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "bestRating": 5, "ratingValue": 5, "worstRating": 0 }
    },
    // ...
  ],
    "image": "<course-image-url>"
}
```

As in the previous articles, reading from files is done in a similar way, but this time I won't use the helper method `parse_csv_content` to compose the vector with lines from the `CSV` file.
Instead, I will use the `json_decode` function to interpret the `JSON` code:
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php"
$file_path    = plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . '/data/reviews/' . $file;
$file_content = $wp_filesystem->get_contents( $file_path );
$json         = json_decode( $file_content );

$course_name  = $json->name;
$review_count = count( $json->review );

$course = get_page_by_title( $course_name, OBJECT, 'courses' );
```
I also declared a few more variables that will be useful later on.
I made sure that the course `names` in the review files in the name field **match** the names of the courses created in `Tutor LMS`.

## Processing reviews
I then started looping through the reviews in the `review` vector in the `JSON` and proceeded like this:
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php"
foreach ( $json->review as $review ) {
    $user_id = $this->search_user_by_name( $review->author->name );
    $new_comment  = wp_insert_comment(
        array(
            'comment_post_ID'  => $course->ID,
            'comment_author'   => $review->author->name,
            'comment_date'     => gmdate( 'Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime( $review->date ) ),
            'comment_content'  => $review->description,
            'comment_agent'    => 'TutorLMSPlugin',
            'comment_type'     => 'tutor_course_rating',
            'comment_approved' => 'approved',
            'user_id'          => $user_id,
            'comment_meta'     => array( 'tutor_rating' => $review->reviewRating->ratingValue ), // phpcs:ignore WordPress.NamingConventions.ValidVariableName.UsedPropertyNotSnakeCase
        )
    );

    if ( is_wp_error( $new_comment ) ) {
        \WP_CLI::warning( sprintf( 'Review of "%s" for "%s" not imported.', $review->author->name, $course_name ) );
    }
}
```
I performed a search for the user's name to retrieve their ID from the database using the helper method `search_user_by_name`, described below.
Then, I used the `wp_insert_comment` function to create the review, to which I passed the necessary values:
- The ID of the course to which the review belongs
- The author's name
- The review date (slightly reformatted)
- The review content
- The custom values of the `Tutor LMS` plugin to categorize the review as one of the `Tutor LMS` course reviews
- The user's ID
- The review rating

The method for searching for a user by name and surname is here:
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php"
protected function search_user_by_name( string $name ): int {
    $normalized_name = str_replace( '  ', ' ', trim( $name ) );
    $names           = explode( ' ', $normalized_name );
    $last_name       = array_pop( $names );
    $first_name      = implode( ' ', $names );

    $wp_user_query = new WP_User_Query(
        array(
            'role'       => 'subscriber',
            'meta_query' => array(
                'relation' => 'AND',
                array(
                    'key'     => 'first_name',
                    'value'   => $first_name,
                    'compare' => '=',
                ),
                array(
                    'key'     => 'last_name',
                    'value'   => $last_name,
                    'compare' => '=',
                ),
            ),
        )
    );

    $authors = $wp_user_query->get_results();

    return $authors[0]->ID;
}
```
In the initial phase, I performed a small normalization of the name, specifically removing spaces from the ends and replacing double spaces in the name with a single space.
I noticed many discrepancies of this kind in the `JSON-exported` file obtained from `Thinkific` course pages.

Then (in lines 3-5), I split the name by space to be able to obtain the first and last names, even when the full name consists of 3 names.
In this case, I used `ChatGPT`, resulting in the combination of the `explode`, `array_pop`, and `implode` functions.

Furthermore, I used the `WP_User_Query` class for the complex query to find the user by their first and last names, and finally, I returned the ID.

## Closing thoughts
With the execution of the last `WP-CLI` command, we now have the reviews added:
```sh
$ wp thinkific import reviews
```

The migration is complete, and in the <Link href="/blog/migrate-thinkific-wordpress-part-5-adaptations-conclusions">next article</Link>, I will make a few adjustments to the theme, `Tutor LMS`, and `WooCommerce` templates."
