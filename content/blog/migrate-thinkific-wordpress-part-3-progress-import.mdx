In <Link href="/blog/migrate-thinkific-wordpress-part-2-users-import">part two</Link> of this 5-article series, I discussed how I implemented the `WP-CLI` custom command for importing users.

In **part three**, I will describe the functionality of the `WP-CLI` command for importing the progress of users regarding the courses they are enrolled in on the `Thinkific` platform.
Below, I also provide you with the list of articles in the series:

## Defining the progress import method
I have a separate `CSV` progress file for each existing course, from which I will read one by one using a recursive statement.

To begin, I define the progress import method, declare global variables, and include and call the `WP_Filesystem` function in `WordPress`.
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php"
public function import_progress() {
    global $wp_filesystem, $wpdb;

    include_once ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/file.php';
    WP_Filesystem();
    // ...
}
```
Next, I define an associative array with the list of progress files from which reading will be made and the course ID for which that progress corresponds:
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php"
$files         = array(
    'course-1-progress.csv' => 10, // Course name 1
    'course-2-progress.csv' => 11, // Course name 2
    'course-3-progress.csv' => 12, // Course name 3
    'course-4-progress.csv' => 13, // Course name 4
);

$file_basepath = plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'data/progress/';
```
And through the `foreach ( $files as $file => $course_id )` instruction, I go through the list of files and start reading from them:
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php"
$file_content = $wp_filesystem->get_contents( $file_basepath . $file );
$csv_data     = $this->parse_csv_content( $file_content );
$i            = 0;
$lesson_names = array();
$time         = time();
```
I reused the `parse_csv_content` method to transform the lines from the `CSV` into a vector, a method I defined in <Link href="/blog/migrate-thinkific-wordpress-part-2-users-import">part two</Link> during the user import.
I also defined the variables `$i`, `$lesson_names`, and `$time`, which I will use later.

## Data browsing and processing
To avoid getting too tangled up, I'll include the entire section on traversing and processing the data, and then I'll add comments afterward:
```php showLineNumbers title="class-wpcli.php"
foreach ( $csv_data as $line ) {
    if ( ! $i ) {
        $i++;
        $chapter_names = array_slice( $line, 3 );
        continue;
    }

    list($email, $completed_at, $percent_completed) = array_slice( $line, 0, 3 );

    $user = get_user_by( 'email', $email );
    if ( ! $user ) {
        \WP_CLI::error( sprintf( 'The user with email address %s does not exist.', $email ) );
    }

    $chapter_progress = array_slice( $line, 3 );
    $count            = count( $chapter_progress );
    for ( $j = 0; $j < $count; $j++ ) {
        if ( '100' === $chapter_progress[ $j ] ) {
            $lesson_id = $wpdb->get_var(
                $wpdb->prepare(
                    "SELECT ID
                    FROM $wpdb->posts
                    WHERE post_parent = (
                        SELECT ID
                        FROM $wpdb->posts
                        WHERE post_title = %s AND post_parent = %d
                    )",
                    $chapter_names[ $j ],
                    $course_id
                )
            );

            if ( ! $lesson_id ) {
                \WP_CLI::error( sprintf( 'The lesson named ‚Äû%s‚Äù of the course ‚Äû‚Äù not found.', $chapter_names[ $j ], $course_id ) );
            }

            $updated = update_user_meta( $user->ID, '_tutor_completed_lesson_id_' . $lesson_id, $time );

            if ( ! $updated ) {
                \WP_CLI::warning( sprintf( 'Update status: ‚Äû%s‚Äù. That means failure or the value already exists.', $updated ) );
            }
        }
    }

    $i++;
}
```
In lines 2-6, I skipped the first line of the `CSV` file again, which contains the column names.
However, at the same time, I retained the lesson names (line 4) in the variable `$lesson_names` because I need them in the query below.
If you recall from the first part of <Link href="/blog/migrate-thinkific-wordpress-part-1-planning-data-preparation">data preparation</Link>, the first line of the progress `CSV` file looked like this:
```csv
Email,Completed At,% Completed,<Nume-capitol-1>,<Nume-capitol-2>,...,<Nume-capitol-n>
```
With the `array_slice` function, I skipped the first 3 fields (`Email`, `Completed At`, and `% Completed`), and the remaining values were returned in the variable `$lesson_names`.
Here, the _chapter names_ of the course were stored.

Similarly, on line 15, the _lesson progress_ was stored.

On line 8, I used the same function, this time to store **the first** 3 values.

Then, a search is performed based on the user's email address.
In principle, there should be no issues with this search, as users should have been created during the user import step.
Nevertheless, for any eventuality, I included a check with an error message.

Finally, starting from line 16, the progress of the lessons is iterated through.

## Processing progress chapter - lesson
I mentioned at some point that I made a compromise and processed only the chapters whose progress is `100`.

To clarify: the content of the courses can be organized, both in `Thinkific` and `Tutor LMS`, into chapters with lessons, topics with lessons, or whatever you want to call them.
So, there are only two levels of hierarchy.
Progress refers only to chapters (or topics), not to the lessons within them, and the `CSV` file is generated accordingly by `Thinkific`.

For example, a chapter with 3 lessons and a progress of 67% implies that 2 of its lessons have been completed.
In reality, I don't know which of the 3 lessons have been completed, but I assumed it's the first 2, considering the natural order of progressing through a course.

Now, in `Tutor LMS`, the approach is as follows: progress must be set per lesson and only in the state of either completed or not completed.
The field in the database for the progress of a user's course is stored in the `_usermeta` table as follows:
```markdown
| umeta_id | user_id | meta_key                      | meta_value |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| 12345    | 678     | _tutor_completed_lesson_id_90 | 1705610847 |
```
The user with ID `678` completed the lesson with ID `90` on the date with Unix timestamp `1705610847` (which corresponds to Thursday, January 18, 2024, at 22:47:27 GMT+0200).
Lesson with ID `90` itself has a parent ID.
This parent represents the chapter of that lesson.

In the Masterclass project, a single course has a chapter with 3 lessons.
The rest of the chapters have one lesson each.
From the perspective of progress migration, having only 8 cases where the progress of that chapter was not 100 (if I remember correctly ü§î), my job was easy.
Manual updating of that progress in the database took only 2 minutes.

## Search and update lesson progress
The variable `$lesson_id` retained, in plain language, the "ID of the post whose **post_parent** field is the post with the ID whose **post_title** is the name of the chapter AND **post_parent** is the ID of the course from the current iteration".
I know, it sounds quite strange, but that's how the query translates üòÅ.

In the end, the user's `_tutor_completed_lesson_id_*` field is updated, and they will see the progress they had on `Thinkific` in the `WordPress` dashboard.

## Closing thoughts
The progress import command is about to be executed, and once again, the magic happens. üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```sh
$ wp thinkific import progress
```

One more step, and the migration is complete.
