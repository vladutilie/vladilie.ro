In this series of 5 articles, I propose to write about how I migrated from the e-learning platform <Link href="https://thinkific.com">Thinkific</Link> to `WordPress`, how I exported the data from `Thinkific`, what technologies I used, how WordPress Command Line Interface (WP-CLI) helped me, and how I made other minor changes to templates or using WordPress API hooks.
Below, I leave you the list of articles in the series:

## Introduction
2023 ended with a small WordPress challenge for me, to which I happily answered with "Yes!".
It involves the migration of the content of the site <Link href="https://masterclassonline.ro">masterclassonline.ro</Link>, a site belonging to the Cultural Association <Link href="https://cartilepefata.ro">CƒÉr»õile pe fa»õƒÉ</Link>, on `WordPress`.

The e-learning site was hosted so far on the Thinkific platform, a platform dedicated to online courses.
The main reason for this migration was price.
And for a few courses, such a platform is too much.

And `WordPress` fits here like a glove.
It's flexible, there are some good e-learning plugins on the market, there's even more flexibility in developing new functionality, and the experience I have is even more enjoyable.
It can also bring some performance improvements.
Migrating data from one side to another is just a matter of time.

I chose `WP-CLI`, the command line interface for WordPress because the process is singular.
I need real-time monitoring during the migration, I have full control over the data, and the limitations are only those I impose in the local `PHP` configurations.
I run the migration locally and only then move the site to the production instance.

## Migration planning

### Assessment of requirements and resources
In my case, the data I need from Thinkific is as follows:
- the courses
- users and their enrollment in courses
- user progress for the courses they follow
- course reviews received from students

The conditions for enrolling users in `WordPress` courses that, for example, require the creation of WooCommerce orders must also met.
In addition to these, on the future platform, I need the following functionalities:
- user registration and authentication
- purchasing courses
- card payment
- possibility of invoicing per legal entity
- users can track the progress of purchased courses

### Create a detailed plan for the migration
For the new home of the Masterclass Online site, I chose the <Link href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tutor/">Tutor LMS</Link> plugin configured with <Link href="https://wordpress .org/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</Link> for order processing, including payment, invoicing, and other integrations.
However, I won't go into the details here.

Next, I studied the e-learning plugin to determine the technical requirements needed for migrating the data:
- Identified filters and actions in `Tutor LMS` that I can use to bypass potential checks.
- Examined the relationships between entities in the database.
- Determined the necessary information to be filled in the `WordPress` instance for a user to access their courses.
- Identified the fields to which other data in `Thinkific` must be matched.
- Established the optimal method for migration (I've already decided: `WP-CLI` rocks!)

**Furthermore, I outlined the list of actions that I need to complete:**
- Prepared data exported from `Thinkific` by normalizing it and removing irrelevant information.
- Ensured that no email notifications are enabled (e.g., for `WordPress` account creation or other emails related to `WooCommerce` orders).
- ‚ùóÔ∏è Based on my research on the functionality of the `Tutor LMS` plugin, there is a need for a `PHP` check to be denied. I delved (probably not enough) into the plugin, and from all the tests I conducted, without this disclaimer, the user wouldn't see their courses in the dashboard. Unfortunately, a filter for making this process easier does not exist in the plugin.
- Executed the import for users, progress, and reviews.
- Reactivated email notifications if they were disabled previously."

### Exporting and preparing data from Thinkific
In terms of data, I had a bit of a challenge, but in the end, it turned out to be relatively easy to export them.

#### Users
Fortunately, there is a handy method to export the list of users:
Thinkific Dashboard > Student Support > Users > Click on the "Export" button.
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/vladilie-ro/image/upload/v1706375897/blog/1.%20migrate-thinkific-to-wordpress/thinkific-export-users_iqqirf.webp" alt="Export users from Thinkific Dashboard" className="rounded-md shadow-lg" />
Once the processing is complete, an email notification will be sent with a link to download the file in `CSV` format.

The header of the exported `CSV` file looks like this:
```csv
First Name,Last Name,Amount spent,Date created,Email,Enrollments,Enrollments - list,External source,Last sign in,Referred by,Roles,Sign in count
```
Of all the data, I only need the following:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Date created
- Email
- Enrollments - list

So, I can either normalize the file and remove everything I don't need, or I can go through the file and select only the necessary data (initially, I opted for the second option).

#### Courses
Since there are only 4 courses, I didn't find it necessary to export them.
There doesn't seem to be an option for this in the `Thinkific` dashboard (or I couldn't locate it).

I manually created the courses in the e-learning plugin and as products in `WooCommerce`.
The process was quite fast; the main time consumption was in visually arranging and styling them with `Elementor`.

The way `Thinkific` exports the user list is a bit peculiar because, in the `Enrollments - list` field of the `CSV` file, each user has a separate comma-separated list of course titles they are enrolled in.
As a result, I had to go through each user's list during the import process and manually match them to set up the user-course relationships.

üìõ The only drawback in this regard is that the developed plugin is not entirely "plug-and-play"; it will require adaptation for that manual matching if run on a different dataset.

#### Progress
This concerns the progress of each user in each course they are taking.
Once again, the list of each user's progress can be easily exported from the `Thinkific` dashboard.
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/vladilie-ro/image/upload/v1706377907/blog/1.%20migrate-thinkific-to-wordpress/thinkific-export-user-course-progress_ez6b8x.webp" alt="Export progress from Thinkific Dashboard" className="rounded-md shadow-lg" />

üìõ Another drawback of the `Thinkific` platform is that progress can only be exported individually, per course, and not in bulk.
So, if you have many courses on the platform and want such a migration, you might have a more serious task on your hands.

The header of the exported progress `CSV` file looks like this:
```csv
Email,Completed At,% Completed,<Nume-capitol-1>,<Nume-capitol-2>,...,<Nume-capitol-n>
```
The values for the columns with `<Chapter-names>` range from 0 to 100.

You will see further in <Link href="/blog/migrate-thinkific-wordpress-part-3-progress-import">part three</Link> of the article series that I made a compromise and only treated progress with the value of `100`.
For the remaining values other than 100, being fewer in number, I took the responsibility to update them manually directly in the database.

#### Reviews
`Thinkific` doesn't have a user-friendly method to export course reviews.
Through a quick Google search, I came across <Link href="https://martechlms.com/blog/how-to-export-student-reviews-from-thinkific/" title="How to export student reviews from Thinkific">this article</Link> that guided me on how to obtain reviews for each course.
Again, if you have many courses on the platform and want to migrate them to `WordPress`, it will require more manual work.

Returning to the point, course reviews are available in the page source of each course.
So, I fetched them from there (after ensuring they are all validated from the Thinkific dashboard!) in `JSON` format this time and worked with them from there (for the sake of dynamics üòÅ - kidding, it seemed easier for me to process them this way).

The structure of each `JSON` object for reviews looks like this:
```json showLineNumbers title="recenzii-curs-1.json"
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "<course-name>",
  "aggregateRating": { "@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": "4.6", "reviewCount": 5 },
  "review": [
    {
      "@type": "Review",
      "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "<reviewer-name>" },
      "description": "<review-description>",
      "name": "<review-title>",
      "date": "November 26, 2021",
      "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "bestRating": 5, "ratingValue": 5, "worstRating": 0 }
    },
    // ...
  ],
    "image": "<course-image-url>"
}
```

## Closing thoughts
Thank you for your patience so far. üçª
By now, I have the migration plan and all the necessary data from `Thinkific` in their respective files.

In <Link href="/blog/migrate-thinkific-wordpress-part-2-users-import">the next article</Link>, I will tackle the part I enjoy the most, implementing one of the `WP-CLI` commands. ‚úåÔ∏è
